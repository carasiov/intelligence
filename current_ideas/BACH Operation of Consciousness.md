Let me play back what I think Bach is actually saying here, in my own words, so we can use it as a clean object to think with.

---

## 1. What _is_ consciousness for Bach?

He’s juggling two perspectives at once:

### 1.1 Phenomenology (the “what it’s like”)

He takes phenomenology seriously and tries to structure it:

- **Now-ness**:  
    Consciousness is always of _now_. It _is_ what gives us the sense of a present moment. For him “now” is not a point but a small dynamic window (~3 seconds) that feels coherent.
    
- **Second-order perception**:  
    There’s “stuff happening” _and_ there’s the perception that “I am perceiving”. That’s not a “thought” in his sense (thoughts can be decoupled, timeless); it’s a _perception of perception_ — a reflexive layer.
    
- **Self-perspective (third-ish order)**:  
    Often we also represent _the standpoint_ from which we perceive. We don’t just see a scene + the fact that it is seen — we also model “the observer over here” with a particular position, identity, story.
    
- **Transcending the self (fourth-ish order)**:  
    You can also step “outside” that. In some meditative or altered states, you notice that:
    
    - the self is a _model_,
        
    - the world is a _model_,
        
    - the whole “Joscha” / “Andreas” persona is a _story_ being generated by consciousness about an organism with a name and social entanglements.
        
    
    Then you experience “just consciousness” rather than “I, the character, am conscious”.
    

So phenomenologically: consciousness = a layered, reflexive representation system where perception, self, and the relationship between them can all be represented.

---

### 1.2 Mechanism (consciousness as an _operator_)

He proposes a functional / mechanistic view that’s meant to bridge phenomenology and brain stuff:

- Your mind is a **representational system**:
    
    - World model, self model, scripts, values, etc.
        
- _You yourself_ are a representation in that mind.
    
- These representations interact dynamically.
    

**Consciousness**, in this picture, is an **operator** on mental states:

- It “comes along” and changes the current configuration of representations.
    
- Key property: it **increases coherence**.
    
    - From deep sleep to waking: the mind becomes more coherent, structured, usable.
        
    - From spacing out to epiphany: attention and coherence snap into place.
        

He talks about consciousness as a kind of **cortical conductor**:

- The brain is an orchestra of parallel processes (areas / streams).
    
- When they disagree or are incoherent, consciousness **directs attention** to the conflict.
    
- That triggers additional processing to resolve the incoherence.
    
- Result: a larger, more coherent “bubble of now” — a stable, interpretable experiential field.
    

So: **consciousness = coherence-maximizing, attention-directing operator over a representational system**.

## 2. The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis

He splits it into two linked claims:

1. **Organismic consciousness hypothesis**  
    Consciousness is a _causal pattern_ that forms in biological nervous systems:
    
    - implements attention, learning, control, world/self modeling,
        
    - automatically gives rise to phenomenology when implemented.
        
2. **Machine extension**  
    If we understand that causal pattern and its self-organizing principles, we can:
    
    - induce similar patterns on artificial substrates (e.g. GPUs),
        
    - and if the theory is right, phenomenology will emerge there too.
        

So “testing for consciousness” gets reframed:

- You don’t stare at a black box and guess whether it’s conscious.
    
- You _interpret_ a system as conscious when:
    
    - its internal organization matches your functional theory,
        
    - and it displays the right phenomenological structure (as reported / behaviorally expressed / introspectively mirrored).
        

In other words: build it according to the organismic story → use that as your test of the theory.

---

## 3. Cyber-animism: spirits as software

This is one of his more poetic but still very “engineering” ideas.

- **Spirits = self-organizing software agents in nature.**  
    “Soul” = the _software_ that:
    
    - runs on the body,
        
    - organizes its structure and behavior,
        
    - has its own persistence conditions (doesn’t want to “die” until loops are closed).
        

He ties this to Aristotle:

- **Vegetative soul**: growth, morphogenesis, metabolism.
    
- **Animal soul**: perception, decision-making.
    
- **Human/rational soul**: abstraction, reasoning, reflection.
    

All of that = **layers in a multi-level control stack** implemented as self-organizing software on biological tissue.

He then gets speculative:

- **Plants and forests**:
    
    - No nervous system, but lots of slow, noisy signaling: chemicals, EM signals, mechanical vibrations, mycelial networks…
        
    - They might implement mind-like patterns at slower timescales.
        
    - Forests might form “internets” and, in principle, should allow software-like patterns (“spirits”) to move around across organisms sharing similar protocols.
        
- **Ambient consciousness / universe-level animism**:
    
    - Maybe similar organizing principles could apply at planetary/ecosystem scales.
        
    - Maybe even universe-level fine-tuning could be interpreted in those terms.
        
    - He doesn’t _believe_ this, but flags it as not obviously ruled out if you take “software on physics” seriously.
        

So “cyber-animism” = treat “spirit/soul” literally as self-organizing, substrate-independent software that can colonize matter and sometimes move between hosts.

---

## 4. Epistemology & metaphysics: computationalist functionalism

He plants his flag very clearly here.

### 4.1 Epistemology

- **Information** = discernible differences.
    
- **Meaning** = relations between bits of information.
    
- **Functions** = stable mappings/invariances in these relationships.
    
- **Objects** = bundles of such functions; “sub-universes” we carve out so we can think.
    

Causality, in this view:

- emerges from us treating parts of the universe as **separate subsystems** that interact,
    
- not something “fundamental” that exists before our modeling.
    

### 4.2 Mathematics & computation

He distinguishes:

- **Classical (non-constructive) mathematics**:
    
    - includes objects defined with infinite precision, non-computable steps.
        
    - You can’t literally implement them in finite physical systems.
        
    - From his stance: if you can’t implement it, you’re kind of hallucinating it.
        
- **Constructive mathematics / automata**:
    
    - Only structures that can be implemented by automata/Turing machines/etc.
        
    - Church–Turing-style: many equivalent computational formalisms, all intertranslatable.
        

So his metaphysical stance is something like:

> To exist (for our purposes) = to be implementable as a computational process on some substrate.

From there:

- Minds are computational processes.
    
- Consciousness is a particular class of computational pattern.
    
- You don’t need new physics for consciousness; you need the right _software_ running on physical hardware.
    

He also pushes back (implicitly) on “humans can do non-computable math” ideas: if that were true, we’d desperately need to keep those people out of data centers because their proofs would literally “break” the computers — but in practice, nobody acts like that’s a thing.

## 5. Consciousness in development and learning

Bach is pretty insistent about this:

- **Babies are already conscious.**  
    It’s not that you get a big pile of smart unconscious processing and _then_ at some IQ threshold consciousness pops out.
    
- If a baby **never** becomes conscious (never “wakes up” into directed, coherent attention):
    
    - it doesn’t learn,
        
    - doesn’t become a human mind,
        
    - remains in a quasi-vegetative state.
        

So for him:

> Consciousness is a prerequisite for becoming a human mind. It’s a _learning algorithm_ for biological systems.

Functionally:

- Consciousness **creates** the world, the self, and mind organization:
    
    - by repeatedly directing attention to incoherence,
        
    - forcing the system to build better models to resolve conflict,
        
    - thereby organizing perception, memory, and control.
        

He also gestures at **neural Darwinism**-like ideas:

- Multiple candidate organizations/scripts may compete in the infant mind.
    
- The one that wins becomes “the self” you remember.
    
- So your “first memory at 7” might reflect a _regime change_ in which a newer, more efficient consciousness organization overwrote most earlier structures.

## 6. Concrete architectural sketches

He does get fairly specific on possible implementations:

### 6.1 Cortical columns + control state machine

- Think of **cortical columns** as units trained to approximate functions.
    
- A **control state machine** sends meta-signals that:
    
    - put columns into different “roles” depending on context,
        
    - dynamically reconfigure local architectures into different task-specific pipelines.
        

### 6.2 Request–confirmation networks & hypothesis-based perception

He imagines small state-machine units that:

- can send **requests** (“I need an object with features X, Y, Z”),
    
- receive **confirmations** from children/features (“yes, this patch of input matches the requested pattern”),
    
- organize into hierarchies and scene graphs.
    

Perception loop:

- Bottom-up:
    
    - low-level cues produce a superposition of possible high-level hypotheses (“vertical edges in this context → maybe trees, maybe poles”).
        
- Top-down:
    
    - active hypotheses send requests to lower levels (“if this is a tree, I should see these textures / branching patterns”).
        
    - confirmations/non-confirmations collapse the superposition.
        

If nothing fits:

- gather more data (move eyes, body, change viewpoint),
    
- or start _learning_ new scripts/objects.
    

Challenges he notes:

- Features shouldn’t be double-bound into incompatible objects.
    
- Requests must overlap without interference.
    
- The whole thing must be **anytime**:
    
    - constant partial results,
        
    - refined in quick iterations,
        
    - robust to scene changes on the fly.
        

His conclusion: hand-designing that is insanely hard, better to **define a search space** and let learning/metasearch find good architectures.

### 6.3 Neural cellular automata & wave-function-collapse-like algorithms

He’s exploring:

- **Neural cellular automata**:
    
    - same update rule everywhere,
        
    - “architecture” is a moving pattern of activations over substrate,
        
    - good match for flexible, self-organizing “software-on-tissue”.
        
- **Wave function collapse** (the game dev algorithm):
    
    - Learn local constraints between tiles/features.
        
    - Gradually collapse a probabilistic field into a consistent configuration.
        
    - See if this can be adapted for perception / world-model construction.
        

So he’s trying to connect high-level cognitive ideas to _concrete_, implementable, self-organizing architectures.

---

## 7. Time, “now”, and suffering

He has a nice, pragmatic take:

- Subjectively, we only ever experience **now**.
    
- Past and future are _stories_:
    
    - encoded in present structure (memories, expectations),
        
    - but not themselves directly present.
        

The “now” window:

- ~3 seconds,
    
- dynamic, slightly fuzzy,
    
- anything that falls outside that coherence bubble becomes “past” or “future”.
    

He points out a practical implication:

- Most suffering isn’t about the actual present; it’s about stories:
    
    - regret about past,
        
    - fear about future.
        
- If you _really_ restrict to the actual present, it’s often manageable:
    
    - “If you’re cold, get a blanket” etc.
        
- Techniques like psychedelics or meditation can:
    
    - dissolve the long narrative thread,
        
    - drop you into pure now,
        
    - thereby deflate the fear of death: you only ever experience now; “death” is a hypothetical suspension outside any experienced moment.
        

---

## 8. Telepathy, resonance, and ambient patterns (speculative side quest)

He briefly considers Turing’s question: “What if telepathy is real?” Not as a believer, but as a “what would it imply?” exercise.

- If some mental functions **exploit resonance with other organisms** (e.g., emotional synchronization, physiological coupling),
    
- then _some_ aspects of your mind might be:
    
    - “computed” partly outside your skull,
        
    - in loops through other bodies and environments.
        

Levin-style speculation:

- Maybe consciousness is, to some extent, an **ambient pattern** organisms lock onto.
    
- That wouldn’t block machine consciousness, but it might:
    
    - make the search space bigger/harder,
        
    - mean that isolation from other minds slows or alters development.
        

This is pretty speculative, but consistent with his “software on physics” lens.

---

## 9. AGI futures & why consciousness might matter for AI

He lists possible futures:

- No AGI (we fail).
    
- Highly centralized AGI (few companies/states).
    
- Decentralized but possibly adversarial AGIs (hedge funds, etc.).
    
- Humans merging with AI and treating bodies as optional containers.
    
- Dumb but powerful AI controlling us (strong, not smart).
    
- His favorite: **universal basic intelligence**:
    
    - each person has a powerful personal AI,
        
    - extending their competence and understanding,
        
    - leading to a world of many mature, capable agents.
        

Crucially, he suspects:

> It might be hard to build _generally intelligent_ systems without something like a general-purpose psyche / ghost.

You might get powerful task-solvers without consciousness, but agents we can relate to “at eye level” probably need to be conscious in broadly the same sense we are, because _we_ care about being recognized as conscious subjects, not just problem-solving modules.

## 10. How this meshes with your earlier framework (very briefly)

Given what you wrote earlier about:

- $\mathsf{IsAgent}$ for macro-agents,
    
- $S^{\mathrm{agent}}$ as a composition operator,
    
- self-boundaries and self-models,
    
- binding as composition and dynamic maintenance of agency,
    

Bach’s picture slots in quite neatly:

- **Consciousness as coherence maximizer** ≈ a process that _actively maintains_ $\mathsf{IsAgent}$ at certain scales: it detects incoherence and triggers reorganization so that the macro-agent remains a good, unified policy.
    
- **Self / phenomenology layers** ≈ internal models of:
    
    - “the observer” (self),
        
    - “the observed world”,
        
    - and “the relation between them” — very close to your idea of an agent that _represents itself as an agent and uses that representation_.
        
- **Cyber-animism and multi-layer souls** ≈ your multi-scale agents: cells → tissues → organisms → ecosystems, each potentially satisfying $\mathsf{IsAgent}$ with their own goals and light cones.
    
- **Machine consciousness hypothesis** fits well with your thought that:
    
    - a conscious agent is one whose self-model is part of its policy,
        
    - and the “brain vs ANN” distinction is largely about dynamic, self-organizing, multi-agent composition rather than static function approximation.
